# Lens AI 

We have started with building a lens plugin for goat sdk which is a popular on chain tool for ai agent. This plugin add support of lens interactions with langchain, eliza  and vercel ai framework

To showcase the use of this plugin we have built a client app using vercel ai framework combined with goat sdk, this client is capable of 
- tipping x amount of grass token to the original creator of post

- fetching the profileid of the original creator of post

- recommending profiles to user based on the given post 

It’s an open source plugin which can be extended further by any community person to add more compatibility to the agent.
